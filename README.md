# Simple-Symbolics

Simple Symbolics is a library built atop MathNet Symbolics. It is not meant to be a replacement for computer algebra systems. Such systems are largely automatic and quite heavyweight. This project intends to diverge a bit from typical CAS to look at what happens when you simply automate tedium and slightly augment a human? The manipulations are meant as much as possible to mirror what a human would do. The code can thus serve as a description of how humans typically approach these problems. Otherwise, it also provide tools that can be combined to do so. An example is indefinite integration. CAS systems can in instances give very unintuitive answers or otherwise fail to complete where a human could. Another difference is the intention to combine with basic logic programming and serve as a note taking tool when reading mathematical papers. This system will then augment the working memory for the reader but also (end goal) allow manipulation of some of the claims.
