# Math Notes

Jan 10, 2020

In developing this library I have noticed myself forgetting which functionality was already implemented (recall is only for those features frequently used) as well as finding some implementations opaque, requiring many hours to recover an understanding. Therefore, I have decided to solve many problems at once.

Every feature should be accompanied by a thorough discussion of the math involved and cover the code at an adequate level. The notes will be indexable and searchable. Lets see how this goes towards automating certain aspects.
